# Minigrep

Minigrep is a command-line utility inspired by the classic `grep` tool. It allows users to search for specific patterns within files, making it an essential tool for developers and system administrators to quickly locate and analyze text within files.

## Features

- **Case-sensitive search**: By default, Minigrep performs case-sensitive searches.
- **Case-insensitive search**: Optionally, Minigrep can perform case-insensitive searches.
- **Simple command-line interface**: Intuitive and easy-to-use interface.
- **Efficient file processing**: Handles large files efficiently.

## Installation

To install Minigrep, you'll need to have Rust installed on your system. If you don't have Rust installed, you can download it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Once you have Rust installed, clone the repository and build the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/minigrep.git
cd minigrep
cargo build --release
```

This will create an executable in the `target/release` directory.

## Usage

To use Minigrep, you need to provide two arguments: the query string and the file path. Here is the basic syntax:

```bash
./minigrep <query> <file_path>
```

### Example

To search for the word "rust" in a file named `example.txt`, run:

```bash
./minigrep rust example.txt
```

### Case-insensitive search

To perform a case-insensitive search, set the `IGNORE_CASE` environment variable:

```bash
IGNORE_CASE=1 ./minigrep rust example.txt
```
